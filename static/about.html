			<h1>Problem Statement</h1>

The aim of the project is to give travelers a forecast of the chance of their flight arriving on schedule. The website presents the user with the likelihood of their flight and other flights scheduled on the same day with the same endpoints arriving on time so they can make an informed decision when purchasing tickets.

    		<h1>Project</h1>

My project uses data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. I collected the previous four years of data for the 20 busiest airports and 10 largest domestic airlines in the United States. The data was scraped from the BTS website using the BeautifulSoup library. The historical data was used to create a binary classification model with the classes being ‘on time’ or ‘late’, where a flight is defined as ‘late’ if it arrives more than 15 minutes after the scheduled time. The model was built using scikit-learn and consists of a feature extraction step where the hour, day of the week and week of the year are determined from the scheduled arrival date and time, followed by a histogram-based gradient boosting classification tree. A custom estimator groups incoming data by the destination city and creates and fits a model for each city. The final composite model was saved using joblib.
<br/>
<br/>
My website presents the user with a form to enter their flight information. The form data is parsed and an API call is made to find all scheduled flights on the given date using the endpoints provided by the user. I used the flightstats API provided by Cirium to get the airline route data. The data for the flights are passed to the model to generate predictions. The model provides the probability of each flight belonging to the ‘late’ class. That data is presented in a table to the user. The website is deployed on heroku.
